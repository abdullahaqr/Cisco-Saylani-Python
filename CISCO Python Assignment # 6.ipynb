    "2. Development is faster and cheaper, with better software maintainability.\n",
    "3. It provides a simple way to solve complex problems.\n",
    "4. This, in turn, leads to higher-quality software, which is also extensible with new methods and attributes.\n",
    "5. It helps in polymorphism, relates with many object.\n",
    "5. OOP offers easy to understand and a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "7. Objects created for Object-Oriented Programs can be reused in other programs.Thus it saves significant development cost.\n",
    "8. Large programs are difficult to write, but if the development and designing team follow OOPS concept then they can          better design with minimum flaws.\n",
    "9. It also enhances program modularity because every object exists independently."
